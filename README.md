SHOPPING SITE

===============================================

1. Served public assets from public folder using webpack-dev-server, inorder to use them dynamically;

2. Nav-Link component from react-routes helps in checking which link is being rendered and adds active class to it, allowing us to style it.

3. NEVER hard code data.. use json data instead.

4. So much to study about webpack config if needed. Used output.publicPath and webpackDevServer.publicPath and webpackDevServer.historyApiFallback for handling routes on reload, since on reload request goes to server.

5. Trying to use SCSS whenever use as possible.. using variables for now;

6. Need to maintain a project level variables file to avoid repetition of styles (section and product catalogue);
